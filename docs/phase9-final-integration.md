### **Phase 9: Dynamic Combat System Integration (Full Guide)**

---

#### **Step 1: Create Directories and Files**

Before implementing the dynamic combat system, you need to set up the required files and folders.

1. **Navigate to Your Project Folder** (if not already inside):
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. **Create Directories for Combat System**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/combat
   ```

3. **Create Files for Combat System**:
   ```bash
   touch src/combat/combatManager.js
   touch src/combat/playerCombat.js
   touch src/combat/weapon.js
   ```

---

#### **Step 2: Implement the Code for Combat System**

Now, let’s implement the code for the dynamic combat system across the various files.

---

##### **1. `combatManager.js`**
This file manages the general flow of combat, such as detecting collisions and triggering attacks.

```javascript
// src/combat/combatManager.js
import { attack } from './playerCombat.js';
import { weapon } from './weapon.js';

// Manage combat logic for each frame
function updateCombat(player, enemies) {
    // Check if the player is attacking
    if (player.isAttacking) {
        enemies.forEach(enemy => {
            if (isCollision(player, enemy)) {
                // Trigger attack on enemy
                attack(player, enemy);
            }
        });
    }

    // Check for enemy attacks
    enemies.forEach(enemy => {
        if (enemy.isAttacking) {
            if (isCollision(enemy, player)) {
                attack(enemy, player);
            }
        }
    });
}

// Helper function to check for collisions (hitbox)
function isCollision(player, target) {
    const distance = player.position.distanceTo(target.position);
    return distance < player.attackRange + target.hitboxRadius;
}

export { updateCombat };
```

---

##### **2. `playerCombat.js`**
This file handles the player’s combat behavior, including initiating attacks and taking damage.

```javascript
// src/combat/playerCombat.js
import { weapon } from './weapon.js';

// Handle player attacks
function attack(player, target) {
    if (player.attackTimer > 0) return;  // Prevent spamming attacks

    // Apply damage to target
    target.health -= weapon.damage;

    console.log(`${player.name} attacks ${target.name}, causing ${weapon.damage} damage!`);

    // Set a cooldown timer to prevent rapid consecutive attacks
    player.attackTimer = player.attackCooldown;
}

// Reduce the attack timer
function updateAttackCooldown(player, deltaTime) {
    if (player.attackTimer > 0) {
        player.attackTimer -= deltaTime;
    }
}

export { attack, updateAttackCooldown };
```

---

##### **3. `weapon.js`**
This file defines the weapon's properties, including damage and attack range.

```javascript
// src/combat/weapon.js
// Example weapon object
const weapon = {
    name: 'Sword',
    damage: 25,
    attackRange: 3,  // The range within which the attack is effective
};

export { weapon };
```

---

#### **Step 3: Integrating the Combat System with the Game Loop**

Now, we need to integrate the combat system into the game loop to allow for continuous updates during gameplay.

1. **Modify `gameLoop.js` to include combat management**:

```javascript
// src/gameLoop.js
import { updateCombat } from './combat/combatManager.js';
import { updateAttackCooldown } from './combat/playerCombat.js';
import { spawnEnemy } from './ai/aiManager.js';

let player = {
    name: 'Player',
    position: new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0),
    health: 100,
    isAttacking: false,
    attackCooldown: 1.0, // 1 second cooldown between attacks
    attackTimer: 0,
};

let enemies = [
    { name: 'Enemy1', position: new THREE.Vector3(10, 0, 10), health: 50, isAttacking: false, hitboxRadius: 1 },
    { name: 'Enemy2', position: new THREE.Vector3(15, 0, 15), health: 50, isAttacking: false, hitboxRadius: 1 },
];

// Update the game loop with combat system
function animate(deltaTime) {
    requestAnimationFrame(() => animate(deltaTime));

    // Update player attack cooldown
    updateAttackCooldown(player, deltaTime);

    // Update combat
    updateCombat(player, enemies);

    // Example of player initiating an attack (you can bind this to actual controls in your game)
    if (player.isAttacking) {
        player.isAttacking = false; // Reset attack after triggering it
    }

    // Render the scene (assuming you have a renderer and scene already set up)
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
}

// Start the animation loop
animate(0.016);  // Assuming 60 FPS
```

---

#### **Step 4: Handling Player Input for Combat**

In most games, players control attacks using input. Here we’ll simulate an attack when the player presses a key.

```javascript
// src/inputHandler.js
// Listen for the attack key (let's say spacebar)
window.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    if (event.code === 'Space') {
        player.isAttacking = true;
    }
});
```

---

#### **Step 5: Setting Up Collision and Damage Handling**

For the combat system to be effective, we need a reliable method to detect collisions between the player and enemies, as well as handle damage calculation.

We already implemented the `isCollision` function inside `combatManager.js`. This function checks the distance between the player and the enemy and determines if the player’s attack should hit the enemy based on their respective hitboxes.

For the damage application, we are subtracting the weapon's damage from the enemy's health in the `attack` function inside `playerCombat.js`.

---

#### **Step 6: Test and Tweak the Combat System**

Now that everything is set up, test the combat system.

1. **Start the Game Client**:
   If you're using a development server like `webpack-dev-server`, you can run it with:
   
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Check the Combat**:
   When you press the spacebar, the player will initiate an attack. Enemies will take damage if they are within range of the player’s attack.

3. **Tweak and Improve**:
   - Adjust the `attackRange` and `damage` properties in `weapon.js` to balance the gameplay.
   - You can also implement a more complex combat system with animations and special effects.

---

### **Conclusion**

This concludes **Phase 9: Dynamic Combat System Integration**. Now you have a combat system in place where the player can attack enemies, and the enemies take damage when they are hit. The combat system can be further enhanced with more features such as blocking, dodging, combo attacks, and special abilities.

Feel free to continue expanding this system with additional combat mechanics such as multiplayer, enemy combat logic, or integrating combat animations!
